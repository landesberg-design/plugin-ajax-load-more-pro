== Description ==

The Next Page add-on will provide functionality for infinite scrolling and lazy loading paginated posts and pages.
Load and display multipage WordPress content on demand using the <!â€“-nextpageâ€“-> Quicktag and Ajax Load More.

The Next Page add-on for Ajax Load More works by using <!-â€’nextpageâ€’-> Quicktags to split the post_content of the current page (or post) into separate pages â€“ as users load paginated content, the browser address bar updates to the page currently in view and pageviews can be sent to Google Analytics for tracking.
